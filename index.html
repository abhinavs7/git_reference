			<h1>Working with git.</h1>

		<section class="topics">
			<h2>git init</h2>
			<p>Set up the initial git tracking folder.</p>
			<img src="images/git_01.png">
			<h2>git add</h2>
			<p>Add file to staging area.</p>
			<img src="images/git_02.png">
			<h2>git add all</h2>
			<p>Add file to staging area.</p>
			<img src="images/git_03.png">
			<h2>git commit -m</h2>
			<p>Commit files with a message.</p>
			<img src="images/git_04.png">
			<h2>git commit -am</h2>
			<p>Be careful using this, it does commit all, so if there are somethings you didn't want to include in the change, don't use this. <br> Files that are not being tracked or files that are being deleted are not included in this. <br>Works best for modifications.
			</p>
			<p>Commit all files with a message.</p>
			<img src="images/git_05.png">
			<h2>git remove file that's been deleted.</h2>
			<p>If you delete the file not using git(eg. move to trash from folder), you still have to make git aware.</p>
			<p>You need to still stage the deleted file with git add "filename".<br>Then you can commit to the delete.</p>
			<img src="images/git_06.png">
			<img src="images/git_07.png">
			<h2>git delete file.</h2>
			<p>You can have git do the whole delete.<br>It adds and moves to the staging area in this step.<br>The commit is still needed.</p>
			<img src="images/git_08.png">
			<h2>git rename file.</h2>
			<p>If you rename the file inside the directory folder.</p>
			<img src="images/git_09.png">
			<p>We need to add the primary to the stage, and remove the first file.</p>
			<img src="images/git_10.png">
			<p>git then recognizes the changes and renames it.<br>Then just make the commit.</p>
			<h2>git rename file with git.</h2>
			<p>using th mv command it takes the current file and the new name as the arguments.<br>Then make the commit.</p>
			<img src="images/git_11.png">
			<p>Moving to a directory is the same. The second argument has the directory as well as the file name.</p>
			<img src="images/git_12.png">
			<h2>Ignoring files.</h2>
			<p>Create a .gitignore file in the root of the directory.<br>These are a set of rules that git can use to follow to ignore certain files.</p>
			<p>Simple instructions are words or basic regular expressions.(* ? [aeiou] [0-9])</p>
			<p>You can also negate expressions with !<br>*.php, would be ignore all php.<br>!index.php would not ignore.</p>
			<p>ignore all files with a trailing slash assets/videos/</p>
			<p>comment with a #.</p>
			<p>It's best to create the file from the command line. Using nano.<br>It will create a new file inside the current directory.</p>
			<img src="images/git_13.png">
			<img src="images/git_15.png">
			<p>Now we want to include that file in git.</p>
			<img src="images/git_14.png">
			<h4>Files that should be ignored.</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>compiled source code.</li>
				<li>packages and compressed files.</li>
				<li>logs and databases.</li>
				<li>operating system generated files</li>
				<li>user-uploaded assets(images, PDFs, videos)</li>

			<h1>Branches</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>branches allow you to try new ideas with out mucking up the good code.</li>
				<li>Isolate features or section of work.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>git view branches.</h2>
			<p>To view all the branches us git branch.</p>
			<img src="images/git_16.png">
			<h2>git new branch.</h2>
			<p>git branch with new name.</p>
			<img src="images/git_17.png">
			<h2>git checkout branch.</h2>
			<p>git checkout the branch.</p>
			<img src="images/git_18.png">
			<h2>git create and switch branch at the same time.</h2>
			<p>give your branches useful and meaningful names.</p>
			<p>Using checkout -b with the new name will create and checkout.</p>
			<img src="images/git_19.png">
			<h2>Compare branches</h2>
			<p>Using git diff.</p>
			<img src="images/git_20.png">
			<p>Using git diff --color-words.</p>
			<img src="images/git_21.png">
			<p>Using get branch --merged you can view the commits made between.</p>
			<p>Using this info, below we can see that new_feature is no longer needed <br>because new_index has all its commits, it's sequential.</p>
			<p>Comparison of content.</p>
			<img src="images/git_22.png">
			<h2>Renaming branches</h2>
			<p>You can rename using the move with the new name.</p>
			<img src="images/git_23.png">
			<h2>Deleting branches</h2>
			<p>Delete using the -d.</p>
			<img src="images/git_24.png">
			<h2>Merging branches</h2>
			<p>First make sure you are in the branch you want to be receiving.</p>
			<img src="images/git_25.png">
			<p>Then use the merge command.</p>
			<img src="images/git_26.png">

		<section class="topics">
			<h1>Stash</h1>
			<h2>Saving changes in the stash.</h2>
			<p>The stash is a place we can temporarily put our changes without having to commit.</p>
