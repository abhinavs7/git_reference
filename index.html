			<h1>Working with git. Making a change on git hub.</h1>

		<section id="commands">
			<h2>git init</h2>
			<p>Set up the initial git tracking folder.</p>
			<img src="images/git_01.png">
			<h2>git add</h2>
			<p>Add file to staging area.</p>
			<img src="images/git_02.png">
			<h2>git add all</h2>
			<p>Add file to staging area.</p>
			<img src="images/git_03.png">
			<h2>git commit -m</h2>
			<p>Commit files with a message.</p>
			<img src="images/git_04.png">
			<h2>git commit -am</h2>
			<p>Be careful using this, it does commit all, so if there are somethings you didn't want to include in the change, don't use this. <br> Files that are not being tracked or files that are being deleted are not included in this. <br>Works best for modifications.
			</p>
			<p>Commit all files with a message.</p>
			<img src="images/git_05.png">
			<h2>git remove file that's been deleted.</h2>
			<p>If you delete the file not using git(eg. move to trash from folder), you still have to make git aware.</p>
			<p>You need to still stage the deleted file with git add "filename".<br>Then you can commit to the delete.</p>
			<img src="images/git_06.png">
			<img src="images/git_07.png">
			<h2>git delete file.</h2>
			<p>You can have git do the whole delete.<br>It adds and moves to the staging area in this step.<br>The commit is still needed.</p>
			<img src="images/git_08.png">
			<h2>git rename file.</h2>
			<p>If you rename the file inside the directory folder.</p>
			<img src="images/git_09.png">
			<p>We need to add the primary to the stage, and remove the first file.</p>
			<img src="images/git_10.png">
			<p>git then recognizes the changes and renames it.<br>Then just make the commit.</p>
			<h2>git rename file with git.</h2>
			<p>using th mv command it takes the current file and the new name as the arguments.<br>Then make the commit.</p>
			<img src="images/git_11.png">
			<p>Moving to a directory is the same. The second argument has the directory as well as the file name.</p>
			<img src="images/git_12.png">
			<h2>Ignoring files.</h2>
			<p>Create a .gitignore file in the root of the directory.<br>These are a set of rules that git can use to follow to ignore certain files.</p>
			<p>Simple instructions are words or basic regular expressions.(* ? [aeiou] [0-9])</p>
			<p>You can also negate expressions with !<br>*.php, would be ignore all php.<br>!index.php would not ignore.</p>
			<p>ignore all files with a trailing slash assets/videos/</p>
			<p>comment with a #.</p>
			<p>It's best to create the file from the command line. Using nano.<br>It will create a new file inside the current directory.</p>
			<img src="images/git_13.png">
			<img src="images/git_15.png">
			<p>Now we want to include that file in git.</p>
			<img src="images/git_14.png">
			<h4>Files that should be ignored.</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>compiled source code.</li>
				<li>packages and compressed files.</li>
				<li>logs and databases.</li>
				<li>operating system generated files</li>
				<li>user-uploaded assets(images, PDFs, videos)</li>
			</ul>
