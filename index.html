			<h2>git commit -am</h2>
			<p>Be careful using this, it does commit all, so if there are somethings you didn't want to include in the change, don't use this. <br> Files that are not being tracked or files that are being deleted are not included in this. <br>Works best for modifications.

			<p>Commit all files with a message.</p>

			<h2>git remove file that's been deleted.</h2>
			<p>If you delete the file not using git(eg. move to trash from folder), you still have to make git aware.</p>
			<p>You need to still stage the deleted file with git add "filename".<br>Then you can commit to the delete.</p>

			<img src="images/git_07.png">
			<h2>git delete file.</h2>
			<p>You can have git do the whole delete.<br>It adds and moves to the staging area in this step.<br>The commit is still needed.</p>
